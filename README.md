# MarioBrosVBA (2020)
An adaptation of Mario Bros on Excel VBA because why not

I've done this game as a project for an Excel-VBA course at my engineering school.

After lunching the spreadsheet, make sure that the size of the sheet is adequate and then go to the lunch sheet to start the game correctly.

To move on the map use ctrl+zqsd key 

The a and e key allows to jump diagonally which can be pretty handy in this game ;)

On this game, we tried to recreate accurately the first few worlds of the original mario bros, I hope you will enjoy it !

PS : At the end Excel is pretty trash as a game enigne but it was funny as hell to make, so do not break your computer because every action takes forever depending on your computer
